## What are you most proud of, and what would you do differently next time?

Hello everyone :moyai:

I did spend sometimes to find different blogs on making elements responsive and after everything i decided to leverage CSS built in function (`clamp(), min(), max(), calc()`) to calculate various sizes for certain eleemnt (parent to children). Maybe this won't work on old browser but i'm glad it worked for the current need.

:seedling: **Built with**

- Mobile-first workflow
- ARIA specifications
- Semantic HTML
- Pure CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

:memo: **What i have done**

- Card details is reflected on the image on `input` change event.
- Each text fields is formatted on change to enforce the correctness of the required format (card numbers, CVC, date).
- Made form elements accessible (centralized error messages, hints on each input).
- Made the solution as close to the design as possible (i don't have Figma files).
- Added custom effects on interactive elements (on focus/active/hover).

## What challenges did you encounter, and how did you overcome them?

## What specific areas of your project would you like help with?

Would love to hear your opinions on any topic.
