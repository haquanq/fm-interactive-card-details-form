## What are you most proud of, and what would you do differently next time?

Hello guys 👋👋👋

This project gave me many new idea on responsive sizings. I feel like i did this challenge pretty solid 😁

🚀 **Built with**

- Mobile-first workflow
- ARIA specifications
- Semantic HTML
- Pure CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

🐲 **What i have done**

- Card details is reflected on the image via `input` event and also formatted to avoid user's typing mistakes
- Fluid responsive card on viewport changes
- Accessible form for screen readers
- Overridden default effect on focus (buttons, inputs, links).
- Used my own judgement to achieve **pixel-perfect** without design files.
